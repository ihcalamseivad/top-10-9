<p>Rugby, a sport known for its intense physicality and camaraderie, traces its origins back to England in the 19th century. Played with an oval-shaped ball on a rectangular field, rugby features two teams
    
    of 15 players each battling for possession and territory. Unlike many other sports, rugby's defining feature is its continuous action, with players passing, kicking, and running with the ball while simultaneously
    
    engaging in strategic collisions and tackles.</p>

    <p>What sets rugby apart is its unique blend of strength, skill, and strategy, requiring players to possess not only brute force but also agility, endurance, and tactical awareness. From the bone-crunching scrums
        
        to the exhilarating breakaway runs, every match is a test of physical and mental prowess. Beyond the field, rugby fosters a strong sense of camaraderie and sportsmanship, with players often forming lifelong bonds with teammates
        
        and opponents alike. Whether played at the grassroots level in local clubs or on the world stage in prestigious tournaments like the Rugby World Cup, rugby continues to captivate audiences with its thrilling displays of athleticism 
        
        and its unwavering spirit of teamwork and respect.</p>
