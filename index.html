    <p>"Rugby is a dynamic and physically demanding sport that has garnered substantial global popularity due to its thrilling gameplay, rich history, and vibrant culture. Originating in England in the early 19th century, rugby has evolved into two main types: rugby union and rugby league, each with distinct rules and playing styles. The sport is particularly popular in countries such as New Zealand, Australia, South Africa, England, and France, where it enjoys a passionate and dedicated fan base. The Rugby World Cup, held every four years, is one of the most watched sporting events worldwide, drawing millions of viewers and showcasing the sport's top talent. Rugby's appeal lies in its combination of strategic depth, physical intensity, and the camaraderie it fosters among players and fans alike. Its tradition of sportsmanship, known as the "spirit of rugby," emphasizes respect, teamwork, and fair play, further enhancing its global appeal. As rugby continues to expand into new regions, its popularity is steadily growing, cementing its status as one of the world's most beloved and exciting sports.</p>
